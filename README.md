## Unofficial [FaceAnalysis](https://huggingface.co/spaces/leonelhs/FaceAnalysis) Implementation

FaceAnalysis is a core library used for facial region detection and extraction.
Future contributors and maintainers should review the official or reference
implementations for details and updates:
-[Surce face_analysis.py](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/blob/master/python-package/insightface/app/face_analysis.py)

The goal of this project is to enable quick integration into other systems
while minimizing external library dependencies.
